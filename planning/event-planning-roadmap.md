# Planning an Event

## Roles

The work behind holding an event falls under two main roles: **Program Lead** and **Logistics Lead**.

* The Program Lead handles everything having to do with the _topic_ of an event: the subject matter, the guest speaker/presenter (including communications with that person), the agenda or schedule of the event, and emceeing during the event.
* The Logistics Lead handles the _how_ of the event: creating the Meetup.com listing, sending the Zoom invite, and posting the recording after the session.

When have enough organizers to help out, the Program Lead and Logistics Lead can delegate some of these duties to another organizer.

These roles rotate, so that, for example, the person who is Program Lead in the first month is not also Program Lead in the second month.
