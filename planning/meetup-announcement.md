# Create the Meetup Announcement

## How to Create the Posting 

1. Sign into meetup.com and 
2. Navigate to https://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-Bay-Area
3. Click **Create Event** and then select **Create a new event**
4. Fill in the form, using the criteria in the next section

## What to Include in the Meetup Announcement 

(Contents of the event posting.)

### The Event 

* Reason for the event (speaker, topic, tutorial, etc.)
* Link for submitting questions ahead of time (if applicable)
* Links to repos, materials, etc.
* What to  bring (laptop?)
* Timeline for the event
* Speaker bio
* Indicate whether food and drinks are available
* If there is food, mention the sponsor


### Getting There

* The location: Mention the company sponsoring the event as well as the address
* Access to the building (how to be admitted and find the space)
* Parking
* Public transit
* Bike parking

### WTD Add-opns 

* Code of conduct 
* A link to our Twitter feed

### RSVP settings

Set the time when RSVPs end to one day before the event. For online events, we need to send the Zoom link to participants, and we don't want anyone to join after that and never receive the link. For in-person events we need some kind of cut-off time because we're usually required to deliver a list of attendees to the venue. 

Set the deadline for RSVPs in the meeting submission form like this: 

* Go to the **Optional Settings** area all the way at the bottom of the form
* Select **RSVP start and end time**
* In the resulting form, set **RSVP close time** to **One day before**

### Final checklist 

Make sure all of these have been done when you save the event listing: 

* Code of Conduct is included 
* RSVPs close 24 hours before the event (so we can send the link to everyone who has signed up)
* Verify the date, time, and location (if there is a location)
* Add co-hosts to the event (at present, at the program and logistics lead should be named, as a minimum)
