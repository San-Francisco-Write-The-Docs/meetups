# Create and Manage the Meetup Announcement

## How to Create the Posting 

1. Sign into meetup.com and 
2. Navigate to https://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-Bay-Area
3. Click **Create Event** and then select **Create a new event**
4. Fill in the form, using the criteria in the next section

## What to Include in the Meetup Announcement 

(Contents of the event posting.)

### The Event 

We usually include the following things. Take a look at a previous event for examples.

* Reason for the event (speaker, topic, tutorial, etc.)
* Link for submitting questions ahead of time (if applicable)
* Links to repos, materials, etc. (if applicable)
* What to  bring (laptop?)
* Timeline for the event 
* Speaker bio
* Indicate whether food and drinks are available (for in-person events)
* If there is food, mention the sponsor (for in-person events)



### Getting There

For in-person events, we provide wayfinding information for multiple modes of transportation.

* The location: Mention the company sponsoring the event as well as the full address (This makes it easy to use Google maps)
* Access to the building. Does the venue have any special requirements before people will be admitted?
* Parking
* Public transit
* Bike parking

### WTD Add-ons 

* Code of conduct 
* A link to our Twitter feed

### RSVP settings

Set the time when RSVPs end to one day before the event. For online events, we need to send the Zoom link to participants, and we don't want anyone to join after that and never receive the link. For in-person events we need some kind of cut-off time because we're usually required to deliver a list of attendees to the venue. 

Set the deadline for RSVPs in the meeting submission form like this: 

* Go to the **Optional Settings** area all the way at the bottom of the form
* Select **RSVP start and end time**
* In the resulting form, set **RSVP close time** to **One day before**

Remember to mark your calendar for the day the link has to go out!

### Final checklist 

Make sure all of these have been done when you save the event listing: 

* Code of Conduct is included 
* RSVPs close 24 hours before the event (so we can send the link to everyone who has signed up)
* Verify the date, time, and location (if there is a location)
* Add co-hosts to the event (at present, at the program and logistics lead should be named, as a minimum)

## Edit the Event Posting

It's frequently necessary to make changes to an existing event, especially if it started out as a placeholder. 

* Sign into meetup.com 
* Navigate to https://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-Bay-Area/events/ 
* Find the event in question (if you don't see it, click **upcoming** to make sure you're looking at new events)
* Without opening the event, click **Manage** and then select **Edit event**
* Make your changes
* Select Save Changes


## Send an email to attendees of the event

If you need to send the Zoom link  or other last-minute information to attendees by email a day before the event. Here's how we do that. 

* Sign into meetup.com 
* Navigate to https://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-Bay-Area/events/ 
* Find the event in question (if you don't see it, click **upcoming** to make sure you're looking at new events)
* Without opening the event, click **Manage** and then select **Contact attendees**. (You shouldn't have to change any of the checkboxes, the default setting is to email "Members who RSVPed Yes for this Meetup."
* Fill in the text fields for the heading and the body of the message. 
* When ready to send, click **submit**
