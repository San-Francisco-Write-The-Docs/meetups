# Upload Recordings to YouTube

WTD SF Bay Area records events when possible, and the videos are uploaded to our YouTube channel. Upload thusly:

1. Navigate to youtube.com
2. Sign in using the wtdmeetupsf@gmail.com account credentials (The same password as when you sign into Gmail. The credentials are provided only to SF Bay Area organizers.)
3. On the left-hand navbar, select **Your videos**. (This is where the content can be found.)
4. At the top right, next to our logo, click **Create**. (It has a red icon that looks like a video camera with a plus sign.)
5. Then select **Upload videos**.
6. In the resulting modal window, you can drag and drop your files, or you can use the file manager to browse and select videos stored on your computer.
7. After you select a video, a wizard helps with the setup. You can skip many of the fields. Here are some tips:

   1. On the first page, write a title and description. If the video is of Lighting Talks, add it to the Lightning Talks playlist. 
   1. On subsequent pages, you can click **Next** every time you see it, because most settings cannot be changed while video is uploading, and you can come back to those fields later (or never).
   1. On the last page, select **Public** to make the video available to anyone with the link
   1. Then click **Save**
