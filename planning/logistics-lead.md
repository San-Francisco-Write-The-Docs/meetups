# Tasks for the Logistics Lead

<!-- This is a WIP (work-in-progress) stub -->

## meetup.com Foo

### Create a save-the-date in meetup.com

1. Name the date and time. Usually a Thursday evening in the second half of the month (set up the date with your co-organizers, to make sure that it doesn't conflict with other events). The start time is usually 6pm or 6:30pm Pacific, but make sure it works for your organizers and presenter.
2. You can leave off the meeting link for now
3. Add the program lead and their understudy, and any other organizers who should be added, as event hosts
4. Add an image if you can
5. Publish the event in meetup.com
6. Watch the RSVPS roll in

### Update the event in meetup.com
* Add the Zoom link (see [Zoom Foo](#zoom-foo))
* Update anything that's changed since you sent the save-the-date

## Zoom Foo

## Post/Promote
* WtD Slack channels for meetups and Quorum and regions
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
