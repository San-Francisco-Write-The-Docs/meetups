This is a general outline of the emcee script we've been using for virtual meetups, slightly adapted from our in-person meetup script. Each emcee should feel free to customize the script and rely on it only as needed to keep things natural without missing key info.

## Before The Meetup Starts
- Find out if the speaker will be releasing slides to everyone (and get the link if they'll be ready in advance.
- Find out whether the speaker prefers questions throughout or at the end.

## Before The Presentation
- Five minutes before announcement time, warn people that it's coming so they can wrap up networking conversations

### At Starting Time
1. Welcome to tonight's meetup
1. Invite new people to raise their hands
1. Offer recommended links in the chat:
     - WtD Slack: https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/
     - WtD-SFBA's website: https://writethedocs-sfbay.org/
     - WtD-central's contributors' guide: https://github.com/writethedocs/www/blob/master/docs/guide/contributing.rst
     - WtD-SFBA's contributors' guide: https://github.com/San-Francisco-Write-The-Docs/www/blob/master/contributing.md
     - WtD Code of Conduct: https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/
1. By a show of hands if you're on video, how many here are mostly focus on technical writing for work? Development or engineering? Product? Support? Something else?
1. Reminder that we're always looking for volunteers and speakers
1. Introduce (speakername) and the topic, usually with the first sentence of the bio and first paragraph of their abstract. Say they will take questions (throughout, and you can raise your hand in Zoom to be called on | at the end).

## After The Presentation
1. Thank the speaker, (speakername)
1. Thank the Zoom Host, (whocreatedthecall)
1. Thank any other organizers who contributed to the meetup and are present
1. Announce that we'll now allow recruiters and jobseekers to share opportunities they have or are seeking, and that people should use the Raise Hand button to be in the queue. Ask people to please give a brief summary and instructions to contact you. 
     - Call on each person with their hand raised and let them talk briefly, suggest any connections that might not be made (like a person who is looking for something someone else described; this is helpful because remembering names is hard when you're waiting to speak in front of a bunch of people).
1. Thank everyone one last time, remind them to subscribe to our youtube channel to make sure they don't miss the video when we post it within the next couple of days, and good (night|day|evening) to all!
